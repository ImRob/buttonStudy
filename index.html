**BUTTON STUDY**

A Simple interface that takes a JSON object and allows the user to drill down to select more specific options.

At minimum they must choose a brand before being able to submit the form. The options are updated if a user goes back and changes an earlier parameter. The focus was on exploring ways to sanely manipulate a UI that depended on nested data using just jQuery/vanilla JS. This is **NOT** jQuery's wheelhouse by any means and a lot of other library's can give you more for less. 

With that said it was fun to explore the push and pull between separating data and UI concerns while maintaining some sort of code clarity.

clone to a local folder and run a simple server using the serve utility.

todo:
sanitize brand and model names when they include special characters or spaces such as Land Rover and Mercedes - Benz
